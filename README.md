# DisplayPort Monitor Auto-Refresh

**Tired of Windows not detecting your second monitor after a reboot?**  
This tool automatically toggles your monitorâ€™s refresh rate to force detection, eliminating the need to physically unplug and replug the monitor. Works especially well for DisplayPort monitors with hot-plug detection issues.

- Toggles between two refresh rates to wake up the monitor.
